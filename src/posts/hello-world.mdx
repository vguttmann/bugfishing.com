Hey there!
I'm (Bugfish03)[https://twitter.com/], although I also go by (vguttmann)[https://github.com/vguttmann] and a few other names.

## How I created this

After coming across (reboot-Codes)[https://github.com/reboot-codes] on Twitter with a post about their website, I decided to check it out, and liked the simplicity.

After talking to them, I forked this project, and I'll try to get it running with the website hosted on my personal server instead of Github pages, and then also have Cloudflare cache it.


## Why I created this

I have a few projects in the pipeline which I want to document because there really isn't much documentation for them out there (like my upcoming PS3 project), but just making Twitter threads is kind of awful if you actually want to follow along.

So, a personal website it was. That also did fit perfectly with my wish to delve a bit more into web hosting and stuff, and with the wish to have my own, *proper* server at home.

If everything goes to plan, this site will be hosted on an HP Gen8 Microserver in a Proxmox VM.


## What's up next?

As I mentioned, I do have a few projects in the pipeline:
 - Setting up the PS3 toolchain and porting Tensorflow or PyTorch to the Cell Broadband Engine
 - Building a (MikroLeo Microcomputer)[https://github.com/edson-acordi/4bit-microcomputer]
 - Adding a "projects" page to help others keep track of my projects, this will probably be done together with reboot-codes
 - A few more Home Assistant things
 - A lyrics display for Spotify that can run alongside Librespot
 - Some sort of black box that takes in a music stream and control the aRGB LEDs in my room
 - completing the Python interface library for my oscilloscope
 - Building an Arduino module that allows me to control a few functions with a foot pedal
